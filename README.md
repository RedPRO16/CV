## Nesho RADEV
Who graduated from the engineering department and pursued with MBA in the International business management field. I used to work as an import and export manager for international companies. Since covid restriction, I decided to kick my career in the tech field.
I’ve been on a self-learning coding journey for a year and looking forward to accelerating this process within a supportive and friendly environment with you!
I have improved my coding skill for HTML, CSS and basic PYTHON while still trying to get further knowledge of blockchain and web3 applications of my interests. I decided to make a switch and start the software development bootcamp with Makers.

## Skills

#### Communication

- When pairing during my Makers course, I communicated the way I was thinking about solving various challenges we were given.
- Whilst tutoring, I have to effectively communicate ideas to students so that they understand concepts and can use them to improve their grades.
- Publishing articles as an Economist required good communication skills to ensure that concepts could be understood by the client.

#### Organised
At my previous jobs, people generally asked me where to find certain documents as I always knew where everything was. I also like to plan ahead to meet a deadline, and not wait until the last minute.

#### Team player
As a mechnaical engineer, you often have to work on your own projects, but I have never really understood that. I always feel you are learning twice as much when you're working on a problem together, such as pairing.

#### Social
I enjoy being involved in the organisation of socials, hence me being in all kinds of social committees in the past! It's very rewarding to see people enjoying something you put together. It's also a great way to get to know your colleagues better.
